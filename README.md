## Creating a Queen's themed online Multiplayer Clue Game because I am bored af and want to play Clue with my friends

I'm making this game partly cause I'm bored and also because it's probably a good experience to learn this stuff... its probably all applicable for real applications other than dumb board games.

Well... I don't know fucking anything and spent the last 1.5 days dicking around. Basically coded the majority of the game in python on VS but the problem is that the game can't really be played because everyone can see your cards and you'd basically have to pass the computer around and that seems useless. So I started looking into how to put it online before I continued to finish the game. Got onto Google Cloud because I dont want to have to pay for anything but it seems way more complicated than the previous websites I built. You basically have to have the python game communicating to the HTML and the CSS and theres also a Java file in the example for some reason?? IDFK. I had the idea to make the board background in HTML and then maybe I could move the pieces around the board by using the Python... like i said I know fucking nothing about this... so I downloaded a HTML/CSS compiler to start that up and... Idk I guess we'll see in a bit.
